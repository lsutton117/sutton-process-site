				<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
				<p class="info">Give and Teach is an organization dedicated to helping children in underprivledged
					villages in Guatemala.</p>
			</header>
			<h2>Determine Audience</h2>
			<p>
				For this portion of the exercise we wrote down every group, organization, or party that would be
				interacting with the website.
			</p>
			<h4>Sticky Note Chart</h4>
			<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/audience.jpg" alt="" /></span>For my audience and different
				important groups to keep in mind, I decided to divide it up into three main groups; those in need, those
				who are helping, and skeptics.</p>
			<p>
				Under skeptics I had the government of Guatemala, Guatemalan parents, and Guatemalan private schools or
				the upperclass. The Government of Guatemala does not place a lot of importance on education and
				therefore it is severely underfunded and in dire need of help. Guatemalan parents often do not
				undersrtand the importance of education or need their children's help at home to provide for their
				families. Even private schools scorn the lower class and refuse to donate old materials to local
				villages. If they donate materials it has to be several hours away from the private school.
			</p>
			<p>
				The groups that are in need are Give and Teach; the organization itself, the children of Guatemala, and
				the villages as a whole, as many of the families do not have jobs or a means to provide for themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				The groups that are actively helping are student missions, the host families that provide for the
				volunteers, Churches, church members that volunteer, church members who donate, teachers, volunteers
				that build the houses and chicken coops, volunteers that work with the childrenn, and other donors and
				humanitarians.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>Overarching Goals</h2>
			<h3>Client</h3>
			<p>
				• Give and Teach is the client. Their goals are to increase teacher training, meet the spiritual needs
				of the community, and meet the physical needs of the community.
			</p>
			<p>
				• Their goal is to train teachers in methods and strategies that will leave no student behind. Helping
				teachers understand the 8 ways children learn and providing materials for them to use will help almost
				every child.
			</p>
			<p>
				• Spiritually, they help by sharing the Gospel through the ministry of Vacation Bible School, sports
				camps, and block parties just to name a few. Give & Teach partners to share the Gospel with hundreds of
				students in public schools each year. Our local Guatemalan staff hold Bible studies in the villages on a
				regular basis. Our medical teams share the Gospel with patients while they are waiting to see the
				doctor.
			</p>
			<p>
				• Give & Teach strives to help meet the basic needs of food, water, clothes and shelter with those in
				need. They have built over 87 houses and countless chicken coops and stoves.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
				• The audience of Give and Teach would be local communities and people in need, Churches and other
				organizations that are looking to give and volunteer with the organization.
			</p>
			<p>
				• Churches and other organizations are looking to give back, help their global community, or make a
				difference in their home country, Guatemala.
			</p>
			<p>
				• To give monetary and non-monetary resources.
			</p>
			<p>
				• To volunteer themselves and work in Guatemala.
			</p>
			<p>
				• To learn more about the educational crisis in Guatemala.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>Website</h3>
			<p>
				• The goal of the website is to explain who give and teach is.
			</p>
			<p>
				• To make it easy to request resources or have volunteers have a means to reach out and connect
			</p>
			<p>
				• To make the education crisis more evident.
			</p>
			<p>
				• To make information easy to find and well designed
			</p>
			<p>
				• Connect with other organizations

				<h3>Goals Conclusion</h3>
				<h4>1. Why does this site need to exist?</h4>
				<p>
					The site needs to exist because there is a genuine need and the children and underprivileged
					communities in Guatemala need help. There needs to be a well-organized website that allows the
					organization to effectively portray their goals and their work, and to have a way for others who
					wish to help have a way to reach out.
				</p>
				<h4>2. Are there any metrics that you or the client may be shooting for? (i.e., traffic, donation
					amount, etc.)</h4>
				<p>
					We want to know how many people are interacting with the website, want to know the donation amount,
					and how many people are seeking more information or wish to help.
				</p>
				<h4>3. What will make you look at this site as a success? </h4>
				<p>
					It will be a success if I am able to design a site that fits all of the information into an easy to
					read and inspiring page. I want people to feel educated after reading the site, but also compelled
					to do whatever they can to help.
				</p>
				<p>The goals of this organization are to help provide for the children and less fortuante citizens in
					poverished villages in Guatemala. Through the use of education, spiritual needs, and physical needs,
					Give and Teach and slowly making a difference in the lives of so many people. The goal of the
					website is to help solve a problem, spread an idea, and fulfill a need. We are trying to find ways
					to decrease the education crisis, spread God's word, and fulfill a variety of needs. The format of
					the website will be a type of service and community website. With goals of organizing, representing,
					reminding, introducing, connecting, and listening. Most of the sites visitors will be Churches,
					church members who were told about the organization, students looking to get involved,
					humanitarians, and locals who see a need.</p>

				<h3>Interviews</h3>
				<h4>Give and Teach</h4>
				<p>
					I had the opportunity to talk with Carol and Mike Claypool, the co-founders of Give and Teach. They
					explained their mission statement which is to rescue children through education and the gospel. We
					ralked for a bit about the site of the Community Center and the progress that has been made.
					Currently the walls have been built and the designs are almost completely finished. We talked about
					what is going on in Guatemala currently as well, from Covid, to the Community Center, to what is
					happening in the villiages.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the volunteers in Guatemala, Mary Cruz, has been meeting with the major and is trying to
					provide a well to some of the locals as a side project of the ministry. Because of the pandemic,
					Carol and Mike have not been back to Guatemala since February 2020.
				</p>
				<p>
					COVID had been a major issue in Guatemala as well and the number of cases are still rising,
					especially in children in the impoverished villiages. They are allowed to go back to school one day
					a week in person. However, many of the children do not even do this because they have started
					working to help support their families. It was common for children to work before the pandemic, but
					since the outbreak many adults have lost their jobs and now rely on the income their children are
					making alone. Many employers are able to hire children at a cheaper cost as well. The children will
					go to work and the parents will stay at home and do their children's homework for them. Zoom or
					online classes are also not an option in many of these villiages because the villiages do not have
					internet or access to computers or other devices. The children in wealthy families are still getting
					an education, causing the gap between who is getting educated and who is not to get wider and wider.
					"It is heartbreaking," Carol Claypool said.
				</p>
				<P>
					Furthermore, gangs, prostitution and other negative activities have increased as well. As the
					Claypools put it, people in difficult situations often resort to difficult solutions. They ask for
					anyone who is able to donate what they can, or even contact them with ideas or possible solutions on
					how to provide education and resources to the children of Guatemala. The greatest needs currently
					are for food and school supplies. Any money donated will go to these causes and to pay for copy
					expenses and materials for the children's schools, as many of the teachers have to pay for the
					schoolbooks out of their own pocket. There is a great need in Guatemala, one that many people are
					unaware of. It is our job to educate the public and do what we can to contribute to provide for
					these children.
				</P>

				<h4>Good Shepherd Volunteers</h4>
				<p>
					For this portion of the interview process, I talked to some of the volunteers that went to
					Guatemala with me on my trip in 2019. They have already interacted with the old website and are
					likely to keep serving with Give and Teach in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					By providing testimonies of some of the volunteers who have worked with Give and Teach on the
					website, others who are looking to volunteer will get an inside look at how Give and Teach operates
					and the impact they can have whether they donate or decide to volunteer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both of the volunteers that I interviewed agreed that it was one of the most incredible experinces
					of their lives and that they would definetely go back. Talking to the volunteers gave me a better
					idea of how impactful Give and Teach is and how working with them can not only change the lives of
					the children but change your life.

					"Guatemala was a life-changing mission trip. Our church did not let the language barrier hold us
					back from going. On the trip we built houses, stoves, and lead a Vacation Bible School for the local
					kids. Seeing the families eyes and smiles as we gave them the keys to their houses was truly
					beautiful. We did not do it for ourselves but we did it with God and for God."
				</p>
				<h5>
					Joie Palmer
				</h5>
				<p>
					"This experience was life changing! Being a member in one of the groups of young adults that
					traveled in 2019, all I can say is that I didn't want to leave. The amount of joy this program gives
					to the people of Guatemala is amazing. As the group built two homes, conducted Vacation Bible School
					for the children, prayed over families, etc. during our stay we saw at a young age that helping
					those in need while being in various villiages is truly a humbling experience. We also saw an impact
					on the lives of those we helped and managed to see the spread of God's love and word between
					people."
