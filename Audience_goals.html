				<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
				<p class="info">Give and Teach is an organization dedicated to helping children in underprivledged
					villages in Guatemala.</p>
			</header>
			<h2>Determine Audience</h2>
			<p>
				For this portion of the exercise we wrote down every group, organization, or party that would be
				interacting with the website.
			</p>
			<h4>Sticky Note Chart</h4>
			<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/audience.jpg" alt="" /></span>For my audience and different
				important groups to keep in mind, I decided to divide it up into three main groups; those in need, those
				who are helping, and skeptics.</p>
			<p>
				Under skeptics I had the government of Guatemala, Guatemalan parents, and Guatemalan private schools or
				the upperclass. The Government of Guatemala does not place a lot of importance on education and
				therefore it is severely underfunded and in dire need of help. Guatemalan parents often do not
				undersrtand the importance of education or need their children's help at home to provide for their
				families. Even private schools scorn the lower class and refuse to donate old materials to local
				villages. If they donate materials it has to be several hours away from the private school.
			</p>
			<p>
				The groups that are in need are Give and Teach; the organization itself, the children of Guatemala, and
				the villages as a whole, as many of the families do not have jobs or a means to provide for themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				The groups that are actively helping are student missions, the host families that provide for the
				volunteers, Churches, church members that volunteer, church members who donate, teachers, volunteers
				that build the houses and chicken coops, volunteers that work with the childrenn, and other donors and
				humanitarians.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>Overarching Goals</h2>
			<h3>Client</h3>
			<p>
				• Give and Teach is the client. Their goals are to increase teacher training, meet the spiritual needs
				of the community, and meet the physical needs of the community.
			</p>
			<p>
				• Their goal is to train teachers in methods and strategies that will leave no student behind. Helping
				teachers understand the 8 ways children learn and providing materials for them to use will help almost
				every child.
			</p>
			<p>
				• Spiritually, they help by sharing the Gospel through the ministry of Vacation Bible School, sports
				camps, and block parties just to name a few. Give & Teach partners to share the Gospel with hundreds of
				students in public schools each year. Our local Guatemalan staff hold Bible studies in the villages on a
				regular basis. Our medical teams share the Gospel with patients while they are waiting to see the
				doctor.
			</p>
			<p>
				• Give & Teach strives to help meet the basic needs of food, water, clothes and shelter with those in
				need. They have built over 87 houses and countless chicken coops and stoves.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
				• The audience of Give and Teach would be local communities and people in need, Churches and other
				organizations that are looking to give and volunteer with the organization.
			</p>
			<p>
				• Churches and other organizations are looking to give back, help their global community, or make a
				difference in their home country, Guatemala.
			</p>
			<p>
				• To give monetary and non-monetary resources.
			</p>
			<p>
				• To volunteer themselves and work in Guatemala.
			</p>
			<p>
				• To learn more about the educational crisis in Guatemala.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h3>Website</h3>
			<p>
				• The goal of the website is to explain who give and teach is.
			</p>
			<p>
				• To make it easy to request resources or have volunteers have a means to reach out and connect
			</p>
			<p>
				• To make the education crisis more evident.
			</p>
			<p>
				• To make information easy to find and well designed
			</p>
			<p>
				• Connect with other organizations

				<h3>Goals Conclusion</h3>
				<h4>1. Why does this site need to exist?</h4>
				<p>
					The site needs to exist because there is a genuine need and the children and underprivileged
					communities in Guatemala need help. There needs to be a well-organized website that allows the
					organization to effectively portray their goals and their work, and to have a way for others who
					wish to help have a way to reach out.
				</p>
				<h4>2. Are there any metrics that you or the client may be shooting for? (i.e., traffic, donation
					amount, etc.)</h4>
				<p>
					We want to know how many people are interacting with the website, want to know the donation amount,
					and how many people are seeking more information or wish to help.
				</p>
				<h4>3. What will make you look at this site as a success? </h4>
				<p>
					It will be a success if I am able to design a site that fits all of the information into an easy to
					read and inspiring page. I want people to feel educated after reading the site, but also compelled
					to do whatever they can to help.
				</p>
				<p>The goals of this organization are to help provide for the children and less fortuante citizens in
					poverished villages in Guatemala. Through the use of education, spiritual needs, and physical needs,
					Give and Teach and slowly making a difference in the lives of so many people. The goal of the
					website is to help solve a problem, spread an idea, and fulfill a need. We are trying to find ways
					to decrease the education crisis, spread God's word, and fulfill a variety of needs. The format of
					the website will be a type of service and community website. With goals of organizing, representing,
					reminding, introducing, connecting, and listening. Most of the sites visitors will be Churches,
					church members who were told about the organization, students looking to get involved,
					humanitarians, and locals who see a need.</p>

				<hr>
				<h3>Interviews</h3>
				<h4>Give and Teach</h4>
				<p>
					I had the opportunity to talk with .....
				</p>
				<h4>Good Shepherd</h4>
				<p>
					For this portion of the interview process, I talked to some of the adult volunteers that went to
					Guatemala with me on my trip in 2019. They have already interacted with the old website and are
					likely to keep serving with Give and Teach in the future.
