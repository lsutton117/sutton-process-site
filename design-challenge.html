			<h3>
				What is the problem you're trying to solve?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Providing a quality education to children in Guatemala.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Take a stab at framing it as a design question.
			</h3>
			<p>
				How might we provide a quality education to children in Guatemala?
			</p>
			<h3>
				Now, state the ultimate impact you're trying to have.
			</h3>
			<p>
				We want to rescue children through education and the gospel by reaching the physical, spiritual, and
				educational needs of children.
			</p>
			<h3>
				What are some possible solutions to your problem?
			</h3>
			<p>
				We provide for the physical needs of children by providing food through our feeding program, providing
				shoes, medical services and shelter through building houses with our mission groups.
			</p>
			<p>
				We meet the spiritual needs by sharing the Gospel through children's programs with our mission groups
				and having Bible studies with men and women in our Guatemalan villages.
			</p>
			<p>
				We meet the education needs by helping provide learning environments and educational strategies that
				will help support children with various learning styles, as well as, meeting the spiritual and physical
				needs of those in need.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you're facing.
			</h3>
			<p>
				In many countries, rote memory is the only teaching method used. Divergent learners and students with
				other learning styles have a difficult time learning in this way. As a result, they are thought to be
				ignorant and ineducable. These children often end up in children labor situations, prostitution, drugs,
				etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				Guatemala has the highest illiteracy rate in all of Central America.
				Village schools often have over 40 children per classroom with little or no resources. Numerous men,
				women and children contract intestinal and other diseases due to unclean water.
				Many men and women lack the skills and education to be able to provide for their family.
				Countless children in the villages of Guatemala suffer from malnutrition.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.
			</h3>
			<p>
				How might we impact the lives of underpriveledged children in Guatemala through physical, spiritual, and educational means?
