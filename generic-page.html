					</header>
					<p>Give and Teach's website is very outdated and in need of some design help. They have a lot of pictures available, but of poor quality. They have several tabs in their website; About, Photo Gallery, Gift Catalogue, Mission Trips, Future Plans, and Contact. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Give and Teach's motto is "Give to the immediate need...Teach for the sustainable future."
