				<h1>Research</h1>
				<p class="info">Give and Teach is an organization dedicated to helping children in underprivledged
					villages in Guatemala.</p>
			</header>
			<p>Give and Teach's website is very outdated and in need of some design help. They have a lot of pictures
				available, but of poor quality. They have several tabs in their website; About, Photo Gallery, Gift
				Catalogue, Mission Trips, Future Plans, and Contact.
			</p>
			<p>
				Give and Teach's motto is "Give to the immediate need...Teach for the sustainable future."
			</p>
			<p>
				Give and Teach is currently in the process of making a new Community Center in El Pino, Santa Rosa,
				Guatemala.
				Here are some of the things they are currently raising money for and fighting for:
			</p>
			<p>
				The Need:
			</p>
			<p>
				Guatemala has the highest illiteracy rate in all of Central America.
				Village schools often have over 40 children per classroom with little or no resources. Numerous men,
				women and children contract intestinal and other diseases due to unclean water.
				Many men and women lack the skills and education to be able to provide for their family.
				Countless children in the villages of Guatemala suffer from malnutrition.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Vision:
			</p>
			<p>
				After purchasing approximately five acres in the Village of El Pino in the Department of Santa Rosa
				(about an hour and fifteen minutes southeast of Guatemala City, Guatemala) a master plan has been
				developed to meet the needs of the community.
				This Community Center will feature:
				a medical and dental clinic, counseling services,
				an elementary school which will also serve as a training center for Guatemalan teachers to help improve
				the teaching methods and techniques in the public schools,
				a vocational training center that will provide men and women skills they need to secure better jobs and
				stimulate the local economy,
				a childrenâ€™s home to care and provide for children in need and
				to provide community access to clean water to promote better health,
				group housing to host volunteers that will build homes for needy families, help promote micro businesses
				such as hen houses as well has helping with other needs of the poor.

			<h2>
				Give and Teach Website
			</h2>
			<p>
				Give and Teach has a website, however it is very dated, unorganized, and lacks any real hierarchy. There logo is dates as well, and some of there font has a shadow effect that is very unprofessional. The pictures that they use are mostly very low quality and in need of being updated.

			<h2>
				Give and Teach Facebook
			</h2>
			<p>
				Give and Teach has a Facebook, however, there are very few pictures and posts on it, and it is very
				dated as well. There are very few posts and not a lot of information is provided. Their last post was from 2012.

			<h2>
				Give and Teach: Research Continued
			</h2>
			<p>
				Give and Teach does not have any other social media platforms, however, individuals that have worked
				with them often use the hashtag #giveandteach which is another source of photos and information.
			</p>
			<p>
				This organization does not have any other brochures, documents, websites, or means of marketing themselves that I was able to find.
